Novation Launch Control Bitwig Script
=====================================

This Bitwig Studio controller script is very simple and does just a few things:
- The controller has to be in 'User Mode 1'.
- The top row of knobs is freely assignable.
- The bottom row controls sends of the first 8 tracks in the project.
- The UP and DOWN buttons cycle through the sends.
