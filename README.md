Novation Launch Control Bitwig Script
=====================================

This Bitwig Studio controller script is very simple and does just a few things:
- The controller has to be in 'User Mode 1'.
- The top row of knobs is freely assignable.
- The bottom row controls sends of the first 8 tracks in the project.
- The UP and DOWN buttons cycle through the sends.
- The knobs have soft takeover, which means that when you switch sends
  you have to move the knob to it's current position in Bitwig before being
  able to control the new send.
